<!--Opening and closing tags in php files-->

<!--If there is no html in the php file, the closing tag is redundant-->

<?php

//I can add a comment here, within the php

/* I can add a block comment like this, again, within the php */

echo "hello student";

//I can also embed html in my php:

echo "<h1>Hello</h1>";

?>

Cookies...

- Roughly how do they work... (assuming that my browser accepts cookies)
- Well, when I visit that website, the website is then able to send a request to set a cookie into my browser
- Allows personalisation etc
- When you go to the site again, your browser cookies are sent (in the request header) to the website's servers which
can then send back some data to personalise your experience on their site (in your browser)...

Let's set some cookies in the next lesson...

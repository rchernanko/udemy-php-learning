PHPMyAdmin is a tool that allows us to manage databases...

Need to get the apache web server and mysql database up and running in XAMPP

Then type in http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ in the browser

Edwin says that to understand PhpMyAdmin in more detail, it's worth taking another course ha! For example - https://www.udemy.com/php-database-connection-to-mysql/

TODO - have a look around for courses at some stage

Anyway, as part of this course, we will probably use only the 'Database' and 'Users' tabs...
